## 🛒 Amazon Clone - Fully Functional E-Commerce Web Application
Welcome to the Amazon Clone, a fully functional e-commerce web application built with JavaScript! This project was created as a learning exercise following a tutorial by SuperSimpleDev on YouTube. The app allows users to search for products, place orders, checkout, and track their orders, simulating a real-world e-commerce experience.

Most of the HTML is dynamically generated using JavaScript, making this an excellent showcase of my JavaScript learning journey and front-end development skills.

## 🚀 Features
Product Search: Search for items by category or keyword.
Add to Cart & Checkout: Fully functional shopping cart where users can add items, proceed to checkout, and place orders.
Order Tracking: Users can track their order status in real-time.
Dynamic Rendering: Most of the HTML is dynamically generated using JavaScript, providing a smooth and interactive user experience.
Responsive Design: Optimized for various screen sizes, ensuring usability on both mobile and desktop.

## 📚 What I Learned
1.JavaScript DOM Manipulation: Mastered how to dynamically generate and update HTML elements using JavaScript.
2.Handling User Inputs: Built interactive forms for adding items to the cart and placing orders.
3.State Management: Used the browser's LocalStorage API to manage the state of the shopping cart and order history.
4.Responsive Web Design: Improved my knowledge of media queries to make the app accessible on different screen sizes.
